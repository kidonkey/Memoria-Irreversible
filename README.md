This is an experimental visualization tool for documents written on Google Drive. It is an interface to your own writing data.

## Instructions
Use this url to download your document's changelog file, replacing your doc's ID and the number of revisions (which you can get installing Chrome extensions Draftback or DocuViz -- another visualization tool!):
https://docs.google.com/document/d/#{docid}/revisions/load?id=#{docid}&start=1&end=#{revisions}

Put the file in the data folder and use it as input for the Preprocessing Python script, and the output of this step as input for the Processing script.

There are some demo files in the data folder to try it out.

## Soon
A more detailed explanaition of the usage of the system!
