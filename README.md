This is an experimental visualization tool for documents written on Google Drive. It is an interface to your own writing data. It also looks very cool.

![A document's evolution](/images/41.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)

## Instructions
Use this url to download your document's changelog file, replacing your doc's ID and the number of revisions (which you can get installing Chrome extensions Draftback or DocuViz - other visualization tools!):
https://docs.google.com/document/d/#{docid}/revisions/load?id=#{docid}&start=1&end=#{revisions}

Put the file in the data folder and use it as input for the Preprocessing Python script, and the output of this step as input for the Processing script.

There are some demo files in the data folder to try it out.

## Soon
A more detailed description of the system!
